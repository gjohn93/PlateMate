##Week 2:

###Wednesday 1/4/2023

We started setting up our project today with code! We set up the YAML file to have multiple microservices (including GHI for React, API, and Postgres database) essentially from scratch. We also decided on and created a Postgres database named platemate. Additionally, we set up pgadmin and are playing with that tool.

###Tuesday 1/3/2023

We completed our Figma to include the endpoints for our Routers. We also worked with the Yelp API to determine additional filters using the Yelp categories for “restaurants”. We chose restaurants as our main term filter instead of food because it looks like restaurant term includes some of the food categories as well. We also forked the main project from the SJP directory. We then manually copied the files into PlateMate and should have a working directory. We haven’t cloned individually because we are still trying to figure out what to do with our database at this point.

##Week 1

###Thursday 12/22/22
We learned we had to change our name last night because Foodify is already taken. We updated our name to PlateMate instead! We don't have too much information on the backend yet, but we are going to use some of the break to map out more of what the yelp API can give us. We also found out yesterday that an existing app called Restaurant Roulette is also using the Yelp API, so I am definitely curious to look more into the filtering capabilities that they tapped into that we can as well. We also started working on the API framework for our app.

###Wednesday 12/21/22
Today we are working on completing the wireframe using the Figma tool. Right now we have the following pages setup with landing page, signup and login modals, questionnaire page, restaurant detail page, settings and a profile page. We don't have the API setup yet, so we are mostly working on frontend while also testing the Yelp API to see what kind of data we can get from it. We also decided on our name as Foodify!

###Tuesday 12/20/22
We continued working on our wireframe today. We are learning more about the capabilities of Figma which is exciting but also slowing us down a little to keep things organized. It is looking great right now with the color theme as well as some of the other features.

###Monday 12/19/22
We worked on a backend design with Excalidraw. This is a bit challenging to do right now without FastAPI, but we are trying to get a general idea of our project. We also started our wireframe with Figma! This is a new tool to me, but has so much functionality!
