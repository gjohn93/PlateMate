Today is the big day. I finished up the ReadMe.md while other members polished the site up. As we were winding down, I decided to make an advertisement GIF to go along with the ReadMe so the team can have something to put on their portfolio. As a team, we handled the last few errors on the site to get it ready for deployment.

1/26/23
Today I finished up styling the resources and the about page to get the site ready to launch.

1/25/23
Today, I met with Riley and discussed that the unit test I picked was one of the more difficult ones. I decided to switch my test to get_allergy_by_id. I completed the test, and I started wrapping my head around the concept.
Later, I fixed formatting issues the team had with the footer.

1/24/23
Today I worked on unit testing. I decided to do Create Account. It took me most of the day to grasp, and I still don't have any progress.

1/23/23
The morning started with a stand-up and catching the team up with everything everybody did on the weekend. I further flushed out the about page, and started ironing out some kinks in design.

1/22/23
On Sunday, I made changes to the API documentation to reflect the current capabilities of our app.

1/21/23
For the weekend, I further formatted the about page and updated the README to reflect the work done in our project.

1/20/23
The group found that the checkboxes did not provide an elegant UX. We decided to work on developing a form to submit instead. After, I started work on the About page.

1/19/23
Today, I started working with checkboxes in the user profile. The solution I found revolved having the checkboxes toggle true or false. I linked them through state, and passed them through to have toggle functionallity.

1/18/23
Implementing all of the utilities we have had planned for the profile page came with much more confusion than we originally thought. Today, Zac and I researched how to use checkboxes and how to have them stay constant with stored data.

1/17/23
After stand up, we merged all our changes from the previous day. After, I worrked on setting up the user profile page.

1/16/23
Today started with a 'merge party'. The group merged all our changes we did this weekend. Zac and I pair programmed and deployed the profile detail page, and started mapping the tables to the front end.

1/15/23
I enabled the router to just take a datetime string, and it will automatically convert it into unix, then feed it to the Yelp API.
That way, all we have to pass in, is a date from the front end as a string. This solves the problem of using UNIX at all.

1/13/23
Today, Zac, Gina, and I worked on front end authentication. We created the Authenticator.js file with most of the froint end auth ready. Two things we learned are thart in JS, array destructering allows us to use "." to skip over any values in a list that we did not want to pull. In addition, we learned that for an onSubmit, we want to put any functions we are going to call withy parameters inside a SEPERATE handleSubmit function inside the onSubmit.

1/12/23
Today, I completed the login page, and prepped it for use in front-end authorization for when the Auth team gets to it.

1/11/23
Today, we successfully set up the front-end! I finished up the sign up form. The others worked on back end auth, and front end styling.

1/10/23
Today, we finished CRUD for allergies and linked the tables. Todaw we were able to complete the CRUD functions for allergies and diet_restrict tables. We were able to enable cascading deletions on both tables. This allows for a user to delete their account effeciently.

1/7/23
Today we were able to complete the search function. We were also able to make a call to the Yelp API using SWAGGER as a GET function. After lunch, we were able to add and test multiple filters to our yelp URL call.

Completed the docker-compose.yaml file as a team. We were able to get PostgreSQL up and running. We got the project in a state where it was ready to be cloned down by our team-members. In addition, we set up PGAdmin. We modeled our database in the sqldbm app and transferred it into our database.
