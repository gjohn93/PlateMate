Today, Zac, Gina, and I worked on front end authentication. We created the Authenticator.js file with most of the froint end auth ready. Two things we learned are thart in JS, array destructering allows us to use "." to skip over any values in a list that we did not want to pull. In addition, we learned that for an onSubmit, we want to put any functions we are going to call withy parameters inside a SEPERATE handleSubmit function inside the onSubmit.
